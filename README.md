Project Description: University Management System

The Uni Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline various aspects of university operations. The system is divided into three key modules:

1. Courses Module: This module manages all course-related activities, including the creation and management of courses and associated documents.

2. Employment Module: This module facilitates the employment processes within the university, managing job offers and candidacies efficiently.

3. Library Module: This module oversees the library's resources, including book management, handling reclamations, and enabling user comments.

The platform is developed using a robust tech stack comprising Spring Boot for the backend, SQL for the database management, and Angular 15 for the frontend, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
